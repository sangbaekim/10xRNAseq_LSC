Single-Cell Transcriptomics Identifies Limbal Stem Cells and Uncovers Their Differentiation Trajectory in Limbal Basal Epithelium of Human Cornea

# Summary
The concept that the rapid-turnover human corneal epithelium is maintained by limbal stem cells (LSCs) residing in corneal limbus has been recognized for three decades. However, the molecular identity of LSCs remains elusive. Single-cell transcriptomics of 16,360 limbal basal cells identifies LSCs, estimated ~320 cells/cornea in quiescent state. 
We analyzed 10xscRNA-seq data of Limbal Basal Epithelium cells of Human Cornea, and characterized their sub-cell populations using R packages from Bioconductor.
